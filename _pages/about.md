Throughout my academic career, I have explored a range of topics within the field of NLP, including, but not limited to, low-resource languages, morphology, language generation, and mental health. Two recurring themes have consistently emerged during my research:

- When working with low-resource data, the incorporation of **external knowledge** has proven to be useful most of the time;
- When working with mental health data and clinical professionals, knowing the internal processes of neural models to **explain their predictions** provided important insights.
